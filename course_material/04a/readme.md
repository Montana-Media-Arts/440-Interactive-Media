# Wednesday, February 15th

## 1. Project Check-In (30 minutes)

Quick show and tell of our projects and current states.

- Please focus on the projects relationship to interactive principles & theory.
    - How do you achieve "interaction"?
    - What are the active "agents", or agents with "stakes"?
    - What interaction principles are you working with? How are they manifest?
- When appropriate, we will discuss the effectiveness of your piece.
- When necessary, we will discuss technical issues holding you back.
