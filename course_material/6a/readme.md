## How can we create a "sense of agency"

1. What is "Agency"?
2. What is necessary for a successful perception of agency?
3. How much agency is necessary for a system to be "interactive"?
4. What isn't agency?



#### Basic Approaches to Agency

- randomness
    - random walker
- probability
    - Raw probability
    - Dynamic Probability (i.e. the walker is more likely to move in the direction of the mouse. )
